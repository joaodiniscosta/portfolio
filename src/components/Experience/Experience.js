                        <p>Beyond software engineering, Iâ€™ve taken on roles that helped shape my <span className="purple">adaptability</span> and <span className="purple">growth</span> mindset as a professional. At 18, I worked in <span className="purple">catering</span>, <span className="purple">providing table</span> and <span className="purple">bar service</span> at events. An experience that taught me how to stay <span className="purple">composed</span> under pressure, <span className="purple">communicate clearly</span> and <span className="purple">deliver consistent quality</span> in fast-paced environments.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>After completing my degree, I moved to <span className="purple">Germany</span> for an <span className="purple">internship</span> in a food production company. There, I <span className="purple">monitored</span> and <span className="purple">ensured</span> the quality of a stamping software system used on packaging lines. This gave me insight into the intersection between software and industrial operations.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>These experiences enhanced my <span className="purple">teamwork</span>, <span className="purple">problem-solving</span> and <span className="purple">resilience</span>, qualities that continue to support my work as an engineer today.</p>
